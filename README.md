## Hi!
Im a solo dev currently undergoing study to learn more about tech and myself. I really love physics and coding and hopefully will get to combine both in a future job.
## Current Projects
Currently I am working on:
- a C++ implimentation of socket to greate a networking chat
- a system to track how many community hours I have undergone

## What Im learning
Im currently trying to learn low level implementation of basic concepts in C++ and C. I want to be able to write efficient programs without the use of too many header functions. For me this will currently involve using external graphics libraries. 

## Future projects id like to make
Id like to make:
- a low-level Graphics library for UI in C++
- a sound wave analyser
- a modular music and sound effect player
